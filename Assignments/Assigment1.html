    <h3>1. What are the benefits of using CSS?</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Separation of Content and Style :
            <p>Separate content from presentation. This separation enhances the maintainability of web pages as changes
                to the styling can be made without
                altering the underlying HTML structure.</p>
        </li>
        <li>Responsive Design :
            <p>Create responsive web designs to different screen sizes and devices.</p>
        </li>
        <li>Easy to Maintenance :
            <p>You can quickly make changes to fonts, colors, and layouts by updating a few lines of code in the CSS
                file, rather than manually editing each HTML element.</p>
        </li>
        <li>Animations and Effects :
            <p>CSS allows for animations and transitions, enhancing the user experience. You can create interactive
                elements without relying on JavaScript or other scripting languages.</p>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <br>

    <h3>2. What are the disadvantages of CSS?</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Limited Layout Control :
            <p>CSS has limitations when it comes to controlling complex layouts. Achieving specific layouts, such as
                equal-height columns, can be challenging without resorting to workarounds or additional technologies
                like Flexbox or Grid.</p>
        </li>
        <li>Complicated CSS levels :
            <p>Confusion due to its many levels. CSS has many levels, which can be complicated for non-developers and
                beginners</p>
        </li>
        <li>Security Issues :
            <p>It has limited security.</p>
        </li>
        <li>File Size :
            <p>If the web page and its styling are very large, it can hamper the performance of the website. A large
                sized file can degrade the loading time of the website.</p>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <br>

    <h3>3. What is the difference between CSS2 and CSS3?</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>CSS, CSS2 and CSS3 are versions of the Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) languages, there are some major
                differences :</p>
        </li>

    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>To control image repetition of the backup you can use the background-repeat property in css.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Background-repeat properties:
            <ul>

            </p>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <br>

    <h3>8. What is the use of the background-position property?</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>We can set the position of background-image :
            <ul>
                <li>Top</li>
                <li>Left</li>

    <h3>9. Which property controls the image scroll in the background?</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>background-attachment: fixed;</p>
            It is fixed on place it is not changed the position, the background image is fixed and the
            element can be scrolled.
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>background-attachment: scroll;</p>

        <li>
            <p>background-attachment: local;</p>
            Local means background image scroll with an element.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <br>

    <h3>10. Why should background and color be used as separate properties?</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>There are two reasons behind this:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>Legibility</p>
                    The background property is a complex property that controls the background of an element, including
                    the background color, background image, and background position. If the color property was combined
                    with the background property, it would make the background property even more complex and difficult
                    to read and understand.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Inheritance</p>
                    The color property is inherited by child elements, while the background property is not. This means
                    that if the color property was combined with the background property, it would be difficult to
                    control the color of child elements independently of the background color of their parent elements.
                </li>
            </ul>
            </p>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <br>

    <h3>11. How to center block elements using CSS1?</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>there are multiple ways to center block element but most common and easy way is margin.first set width
                and then give margin:0 auto;</p>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <br>

    <h3>12. How to maintain the CSS specifications?</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>The CSS specifications are maintained by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C).</p>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <br>

    <h3>13. What are the ways to integrate CSS as a web page?</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>Inline CSS:</p>
            To use inline CSS, simply add the style attribute to an HTML element.
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Internal CSS:</p>
            To use internal CSS, create a (style) element in the head section of your HTML document.

        </li>

        <li>
            <p>External CSS:</p>
            To use external CSS, create a CSS file with the .css extension. Then, in the (head) section of your HTML
            document, add a (link) element to the CSS file.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <br>

    <h3>14. What is embedded style sheets?</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>Embedded style sheets also known as internal css.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>In this method we use &lt;style&gt; tag inside
                &lt;head&gt; tag and write the css rules.</p>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <br>

    <h3>15. What are the external style sheets?</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>External style sheets are CSS style sheets that are saved as separate files with the .css extension.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>They are linked to HTML documents using the (link) element in the head section of the document</p>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <br>

    <h3>16. What are the advantages and disadvantages of using external style sheets?</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>Advantages and disadvantages of using external style sheets :</p>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <table BORDER="2" ALIGN="center" width="80%" height="300px" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="2">
        <thead>
            <tr ALIGN="center">
                <th width="40%">Advantages</th>
                <th width="40%">Disadvantages</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr ALIGN="center">
                <td>Efficiency: External style sheets are only parsed once by the browser, regardless of how many
                    HTML pages they are linked to. This can significantly improve page loading times.</td>
                <td>Complexity: External style sheets can add complexity to a website, especially if there are a large
                    number of CSS files.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr ALIGN="center">
                <td>Maintainability: External style sheets are easier to maintain than inline and embedded style
                    sheets because changes to the CSS file are automatically reflected in all of the HTML pages that
                    link to it.</td>
                <td>Load time: External style sheets can add to the initial load time of a website, as the browser needs
                    to download the CSS files before it can render the page.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr ALIGN="center">
                <td>Consistency: External style sheets can help to ensure that all of the pages on a website have a
                    consistent style. This is because the CSS file can be used to define a single set of styles that can
                    be applied to all of the pages on the website.</td>
                <td>Debugging: External style sheets can be more difficult to debug than inline and embedded style
                    sheets, as it can be difficult to track down the source of a styling issue.</td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>
    <br>

    <h3>17. What is the meaning of the CSS selector?</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>CSS selectors are used to select the HTML elements that you want to style.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Types :
            <ul>

                    other HTML elements.</li><br>
                <li><b>Group Selectors:</b> Grouping selector is used to select all the elements with the same style
                    definitions.
                    Grouping selector is used to minimize the code. Commas are used to separate each selector in
                    grouping.</li><br>
                <li><b>Pseudo-class selectors:</b> Pseudo-class selectors match HTML elements based on their state, such
                    as being hovered over or focused.</li><br>
                <li><b>Pseudo-element selectors:</b> Pseudo-element selectors match parts of HTML elements, such as the
                    first letter of a paragraph or the link state of an anchor element.</li><br>
                <li><b>Attribute selectors:</b> Attribute selectors match HTML elements based on their attributes.</li>
            </ul>
